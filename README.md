# Linked Data Notifications for aggregation of IIIF Services

This project aims to provide an experimental software tool for allowing a metadata aggregator to discover the resources made available by a [IIIF service](http://iiif.io) (International Image Interoperability Framework) and to be notified about changes in the availability of resources over time.

It is being developed in the context of the participation of [Europeana](http://europeana.eu) in the [IIIF Discovery Support Technical Specifications Group](https://gist.github.com/azaroth42/01cd1a377d519e29572b8b072ac5980a).  

A software if developed in Java, and contains an implementation of[Linked Data Notifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/) (according to the [W3C Candidate Recommendation 23 February 2017](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/CR-ldn-20170223/).

Status:
 - Linked Data Notifications implementation of a 'Consumer'.
 - Interaction with IIIF services is at design stage.
